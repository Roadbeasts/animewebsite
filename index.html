<h4>The Story : </h4>
<br><br><br>
<p2> Sara is the CEO Of The Association called 'Roadbeasts' Where she helps people from protecting their rights , fighting criminals, doing

groceries for poeple who are sick etc... One day she gets a call from Hassan , the second richest person after SDA of course , telling her that
his daughter went to a wild adventure and never came back, his doughting on 'Wealth' a place where you get so much distracted that you loose your
way where came from. In order to get to wealth , Sara has to collect keys , or that are known as 'The Winds and Hints'. Basically she has to solve 
mysteries, the more she does , the closer she gets to wealth. But what will happen if she failed on solving one ? That's what pisses Sara , because 
she doesn't know , in fact even Hassan hasn't told her everything about wealth. Good to know that she is not alone , at least with her 2 members , Zakaria and Aya
 both helping her on the mission. But wait , that's not all , SDA or Secret Department Agency is the government of Sara's Country, and the SDA police department 
is after her for what she is doing , they have their reasons why they need to stop Sara. But Hey ! The moral of the story is :  Sara needs to learn about each location of
The Winds and Hints , not getting cought by SDA Police Department and much more , which means she needs to be startegic and knows what she's up to , right? Enoy what's gonna
happen...

<h5>The Characters :<h5>
<br><br><br>
	
<img src="newsara.png"height="700" width="1300">
	<br><br>
	
	<p3>Introducing one of the most brave characters, Sara.She is the CEO Of Roadbeasts, she will lead this mission. She is a hard worker person, doesn't do a lot of entertainment,
	and she doen't need that to be honest, not right now , as she has no idea what's coming.</p3>
	
	<br><br><br>
	<img src="newyahya.png" height="700" width="1300" style="float:right">
	<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
	
	<p4>Yahya.Leader of the SDA Police Department. Wait a mimute isn't being a policeman consist of helping the citizens? But wait Sara is already taking care of that. Hold up for a sec
	what is going on here ? Well my friend , if you have these kind of quetions , then you know nothing about SDA. Anyways as a leader , Yahya is in charge of stopping Sara from what she does, it's 
	an order from his supperiours. Which means he has no choice . The real quetion is , what will he do about stopping his own sister?</p4>
	<br><br>
	<h6><center>IF YOUR CURIOUS ABOUT SDA , WE HAVE A SEPERATE BOOK THAT TALKS ABOUT THAT , WITH ANOTHER STORY OF COURSE, <i>IT'S FREE NO WORRIES</i></center></h6>
	
	<br><br><br>
	<img src="newaya.png" height="700" width="1300">
	<br><br><br>
	
	<p5>Aya. STOP STARRING AT MY CRUSH (LOL). NO but like let's be honest , first of all , she is the opposit of Sara , inspite of being a member of the Roadbeasts , 
		she loves hanging out and having fun,she doesn't care about what life will throw at her , as she is always ready for any challenges , also she is the best friend of Sara, yeah that
		is another point i was about to forget.</p5>
	
	<br><br><br>
	<img src="newanas.png" height="700" width="1300" style="float:right">
	<br><br><br><br><br>
	<p6>Anas.Intoducing Sara's other brother, he is younger than yahya and he is working in SDA Police Department like Yahya, except that he hasn't the same position.Anyways once again it's gonna be
	very intersting to see his reaction toward stopping his sister, also working with his brother, i don't want to spoil, stay tuned.</p6>
	<br><br><br>
	<img src="newzakaria.png" height=""700 width="1300">
	<br><br><br>
	<p7>Zakaria. Introducing a new member to not only Roadbeasts but also to Fine city, this guy has just been transferred from his world Morocco to Sara's. Yeah ! I don't think he is ready
		for what Sara has just started to be facing , also i do want to mention that he is a not quitter , that's good as he need that mind set. To be honest once again, he is in the same position as you are,
		you know , since he is new, he doen't know much about Fine city or what SDA is , so i think you will get familiar with that character a lot , i don't know, just saying...</p7>
	

<br><br><br><br>
	<center><h7>SDA</h7></center>
	<br><br><br>
	<p8>Or Secret Department Agency , is the government of Fine city , the country of Sara, Yahya, Anas, and well i guess Zakaria too from now on. SDA is not only the gonernment but also a place that 
	no one knows what's going on inside. Once you get accepted to work for any department , weather Science, Technology, Health etc... you enter SDA but you will never come back, to the point that 
	once your dead  your family will only receive a letter that you are no longer part of this life. One thing, at least, that i like about SDA is that, considering that you will never see your 
	family SDA makes your family richer by bringing them from povrety to wealth, so it's 50 50. Anyways their is a lot to know about what's inside, SDA controlls everything from television, marketting,science,technology and much 
	more. Don't worry , because this is where our Book 'SDA'.Well it's about 4 characters... You know what? Just click on the link to be transferred directly to the book.</p8>
